          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>BREW & SCULPT started as a passion project between two university friends - a barista champion and a classical sculpture artist. Inspired by Renaissance salons, we began with pop-up events in local markets, combining coffee service with art exhibitions that celebrated the marriage of functional and fine arts.</p>
            <p>Our first events featured live sculpture demonstrations alongside specialty coffee tastings, creating a unique multi-sensory experience that quickly gained attention in Cape Town's creative community.</p>

          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>We opened our first small café in a restored heritage building in Woodstock, featuring exposed brick walls, classical archways, and custom-made display niches for sculptures. The space quickly became a hub for local artists, writers, and coffee enthusiasts seeking inspiration.</p>
            <p>Our unique concept of pairing each coffee blend with a featured sculpture gained recognition, with local media calling us "a modern Renaissance salon for the digital age."</p>

The new space incorporates classical design elements with modern functionality, creating an authentic Renaissance atmosphere.</p>
            <p>To date, we've supported over 50 local artists, hosted 12 major exhibitions, and become a recognized platform for emerging talent in South Africa's art scene while maintaining our commitment to coffee excellence.</p>
